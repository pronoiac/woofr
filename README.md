Woofr

*Flickr for dogs!*

This is my final project for App Academy, a web developer bootcamp. 
It covered Ruby on Rails, SQL, Javascript, jQuery, and Backbone.js. 
This is a slight site, but it was fun to build. 

Demo
----
Go to [woofr.pronoiac.org](http://woofr.pronoiac.org/) to see it in action! You'll have to hit "sign in as guest" to see anything. 

Features
--------
It has many pictures of dogs; also, tags, and comments.
