    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    It's Flickr for dogs. 
    <h2>How do logins work?</h2>
    To check the site out, hit the "Sign in as guest" button. 
    Then if you want to register, click "Signed in as guest," and select "Sign up." 
    <p>This is admittedly roundabout, but the TAs had feelings about the matter.
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    It's a class project from <a href="/pages/contact">James Young.</a> He felt that cats got a <i>lot</i> of attention in class, while dogs were <i>criminally</i> underrepresented. 
    <h2>Where'd you get the pictures?</h2>
    Various places! <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?text=dog&license=1%2C2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6&sort=relevance">Flickr lets you search for images tagged for Creative Commons use,</a> and <a href="http://www.putyouinabettermood.com/">Put You in a Better Mood</a> was very helpful! 
    <h2>So you're a dog person.</h2>
    That may be an understatement.
